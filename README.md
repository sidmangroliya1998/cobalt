## cobalt api
cobalt has an open api that you can use in projects *for completely free~*. it's easy and straightforward to use, [check out the docs](https://github.com/wukko/cobalt/blob/current/docs/api.md) to learn how to use it. 

you can use the main api instance ([co.wuk.sh](https://co.wuk.sh/)) in your projects.

## how to run your own instance
if you want to run your own instance for whatever purpose, [follow this guide](https://github.com/wukko/cobalt/blob/current/docs/run-an-instance.md).  
it's *highly* recommended to use a docker compose method unless you run for developing/debugging purposes.
