## how to fix clipboard pasting in firefox
you can fix this issue by changing a single preference in `about:config`.

### steps to enable clipboard functionality
1. go to `about:config`:  

   ![screenshot showing about:config entered into address bar](https://github.com/wukko/cobalt/assets/71202418/9ad78612-a372-4949-aeac-99dfc41e273c)  

2. if asked, read what firefox has to say and press "accept the risk and continue".  
 âš  tinkering with other preferences may break your browser. **do not** edit them unless you know what you're doing.   

   ![screenshot showing about:config security warning that reads: "proceed with caution. changing advanced configuration preferences can impact firefox performance or security." lower there's a pre-checked checkbox that says: "warn me when i attempt to access these preferences". lowest element is a blue button that says "accept the risk and continue"](https://github.com/wukko/cobalt/assets/71202418/02328729-dbfe-4ea4-b2ca-7bcf1998c2ca)  

3. search for `dom.events.asyncClipboard.readText`

5. "false" should change to "true".
